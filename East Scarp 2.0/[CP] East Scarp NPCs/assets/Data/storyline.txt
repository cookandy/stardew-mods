************************************

Jacob and Del met in vet school. He was a recently graduated tutor, and she was training to be a vet nurse. Whilst they were immediately attracted to each other, they maintained a professional relationship until she graduated, after which he invited her out for a celebratory drink.
Less than a year later they were married.
He took a job in Gotoro and loved it there. Eloise was born a few years later.
Then Del became ill.

The Gotoran attitude towards Ferngillians was becoming increasingly hostile, and rather than seek treatment in Gotoro, they took their 3 year old daughter and returned to Ferngill.
Del became worse, and eventually died.
Eloise was six.

Jacob kept contact with one of Del's close friends there, Hanna, and as she grew older, Eloise insisted on sending letters to her son, Sora. The two were almost the same age, being born days apart.

They'd played together as toddlers, but of course Eloise couldn't remember that.

Jacob got work in the Stardew Valley area, tending to hoofstock and also turning his hand to wildlife rehabilitation. His letters to Hanna became fewer and farther between, but Eloise still insisted on writing to Sora every week.

When the mail service between continents collapsed, he started to resort to passing letters through the local smuggler.He suspects that sometimes she brings out more than just wares.


************************************
Now, Clint and Jacob as brothers... <not currently implemented, still deciding>
************************************

Jacob was always the smartest, the better looking. He was always shy, but in a polite way that tended to endear people to him. 
His younger brother, Clint, was also shy. But in a far less endearing manner. He would sulk. It was always "poor me" and he acted as though he were the one wronged.
The two siblings did not get on.
Their father was a no-nonsense, hardworking blacksmith. He wanted his sons to be manly from the start, and whilst Jacob escaped the majority of his disdain by getting good grades and insisting that he was going to become a doctor (he always wanted to be an animal doctor, but didn't dare admit _that_), Clint was a real "Mommy's boy". Soft, his father described him.
He was never beaten, nor physically abused in any way, but the emotional damage was true... His father just didn't love him.
Then there was the accident in the mines.
their father lost most of his clientele, and his business fell apart. They divorced.
Their mother moved to Zuzu City, and Clint was basically bullied into staying with his father, to continue in the "family business".
He didn't want to, but he didn't have any other prospects, and it was easier not to argue. So he stayed.
Pelican Town began to fall apart.
Jacob went on to pursue his dreams at university. Then took up a post as far from his dysfunctional family as possible: in Gotoro.
Their father became depressed, started spending more and more time away from home, and one day vanished.
Rumor had it he ran away with a woman.
Clint took over the blacksmith trade. 

Clint and Jacob are estranged. Even when Jacob moved back to Pelican Town, taking over the old stone house, they never really connected.
There was too much bad blood between them.
Clint, angry that his brother hadn't helped him more, or stood up for him.
Jacob, pushed away by his brother's sarcasm and self-pity.

*********************
Jacob's heart events:
*********************

2-heart event:
Eloise drags you into the barn, here Jacob is tending to an injured animal. He is at first shy, but Eloise basically badgers him into answer questions. He needs the farmer's help - perhaps to hold the animal? Eloise is too small and it's potentially dangerous.
Maybe a cow? Or possibly an alpaca? Eloise makes some comment that she wishes her uncle could've helped, but he distracts her mid-sentence, clearly not wanting to talk about personal matters with the farmer.
After this scene you are granted access to the barn.
(Maybe it could sometimes spawn wool?)

4-heart mini-event (4 hearts Jacob and Clint):
Jacob and Clint run into each other in town. An argument ensues. What are they arguing about? Why are they arguing? Jacob isn't the argumentative sort... maybe he's tried to approach Clint and Clint's pushing him away?

4-heart event:
Jacob is distraught. He is due to head into the mountains to collect some released chickens, and the person who was supposed to be assisting him has not turned up. If the chickens aren�t captured today, they�re going to be killed, but he�s not sure he can catch dozens of chickens alone.
Farmer can offer to help.
If yes, both jump in the truck, it fades to black (bus noises?) and farmer finds themselves in the Deep Mountains. There are a lot of chickens. How much to show in the capturing scene? It�s a pity farmer can�t be given a chicken. 

6-heart event:
Farmer finds Jacob standing by his wife's grave. He tells farmer about Del, and about life in the Gotoro Republic. He expresses his concerns about bringing up his daughter without a mother figure. 
Farmer can reassure him (or not).
This one needs to be a little more interesting.... Maybe Jacob is telling Eloise a goodnight story, something about her mother, and runs into farmer as he's leaving her to sleep. He then confides in farmer about his worries.
- You're doing a fine job!
- It would be better for her to have a woman in her life.
- Have you considered remarrying?

8-heart event
Some sort of culmination of events? A family tragedy means he has to approach Clint - maybe their mother is ill. He really wants Clint to reconcile and seeks farmer's help. Farmer can aid or inhibit. (this awkwardly is not even slightly compatible with Clarice, except that she too is estranged from her mother, but for entirely understandable reasons).

10-heart event
Reconiliation between the two siblings. Eloise is stoked. She immediately wants her Uncle to help her make all manner of cool things.

**********************
Eloise's heart events:
**********************

2-heart event
The duck arrives.

4-heart event:
Eloise talks about Sora

6-heart event:
Another duck one?

8-heart event part one:
Something relating to Sora and the war in Gotoro?
Eloise is crying. She hasn�t received a letter from Sora in weeks, and the last time she heard from him, he and his mother had been hiding in a basement and she saw on the news that the city he was in has been bombed. She�s really worried something terrible might have happened to him.
Farmer can comfort her, or give her the cold harsh truth.

8-heart event part two: (about 14 days later)
Eloise greets the player all happy smiles. Sora is safe! He and his mother and baby sister had to escape the city through the sewers, but they did, and now they�re in the countryside, far away from danger, in a little valley like Stardew Valley. They�re growing their own food and everything.

10-heart event
Eloise decides to match-make farmer up with her Dad. It starts with a letter sent through the mail (somehow indicate that it is not Jacob�s writing, maybe excessive !! marks).

�Hi farmer @!
I just wanted to write and say that I really like you lots, and you should come over for dinner tomorrow night! What do you think? Dinner is at 6!^
I really really home you�ll come!^ With love,^Jacob XXOO.�
%% conversationTopic JacobDate 1%% [#]Letter from Jacob??�

If either is talked to within the day, Eloise will badger farmer about how much she hopes they�ll come. Jacob will be friendly but not unusually so.

Scene starts with Eloise fussing over her Dad and him being very perplexed. Why is she asking him about what he�s wearing? Sure, he�s invited farmer over for dinner, but that�s because they�re good friends. Nothing else.
Farmer knocks on the door, Eloise bounces over to answer it.
�Dad�s ever so happy you�re coming for dinner! He�s a really good cook, you know.�

********************
Eloise and Leo 
********************
Eloise likes Leo, but is worried that he thinks she's too chatty, and that he likes Jas better. Perhaps she overheard his comment to the farmer (imply it).
So she decides to ask the farmer for advice 
Farmer can suggest:
- I'm sure he likes you just fine, but perhaps you could try listening more.
- You talk far too much and ask too many questions. It's no wonder he doesn't like you!
First option: Eloise accepts your judgment and vows to try and talk less and listen more.
Second option: Eloise gets upset, loses -250 friendship and runs away. Also vowing to talk less.

Leo, who is used to her chatter, thinks she's mad at him, and comes to the farmer for advice.
Farmer can suggest:
- She really likes you, but she's trying to be more like Jas.
- She thinks you're weird.
First Option: Leo is relieved and confronts Eloise, reassuring her that he likes her the way she is and he's glad she's not mad at him.
Second Option: Leo is upset, loses -50 friendship but decides to ask her about it anyway. To which she reassures him that she's not mad at him, just that she thought he liked Jas better and decided to be more like her.

Eloise goes to Leo for advice. Richie doesn't seem very well, but her dad can find nothing physically wrong with him, and she's worried that something is very wrong with him. Perhaps he'll tell Leo? Leo talks to Richie and learns that Richie is feeling lonely. She doesn't spend as much time with him anymore, and he's bored.

******************
Aideen
******************

2 hearts
Aideen is first seen talking to her cat. Bemoaning the fact that she wishes life were like one of her books, that a handsome and sophisticated man might come sauntering through her door and sweep her off her feet.
Enter the farmer.
Aideen is embarrassed, hopes that they have not heard her pouring out her soul to her cat, and covers it by saying she has listed the spare rooms on some sort of stardew equivalent of Air B n B. But alas, no one has yet taken her up on the offer. 
Farmer can offer some advice:
- It�s early days yet.
	�Oh my, the glass is certainly half full for you, isn�t it? Still, a little optimism will certainly be advantageous for %farm, I do not doubt.
- This is hardly a vacation spot.
 	�Oh, aren�t you Mr/Mrs Cynical.#$b#You�re right, of course. Pelican Town is hardly Paradise Bay.#$b#Yet the peace might be an attraction in itself, don�t you think?
Carry On. 


- Maybe you�re being too picky.
	�Picky?$a#$b#It is no shame, nor crime, to be discerning.#$b#Indeed, it would be most disadvantageous to invite an unruly guest into my house.#$b#On that note, perhaps it is time you should leave, for surely that farm must require your attention.
- I hear you�re looking for a suitor.
	�Oh! The gall of you! To listen in on a lady�s private conversation.#$b#Perhaps you should take your nose and poke it into someone else�s business!$a
End

Could then follow with a series of vinagrettes where Aideen interviews different custom NPCs or townsfolk and dismisses them. 

4 hearts:
you receive a letter. Aideen is flustered! She�s had an order for a very special bouquet and her delivery never arrived. She requires you to bring to her house her immediately, four flowers:
Crocus, poppy, fairy rose, sweet pea
It is highly unlikely farmer will be able to immediately comply with this request.
But where they do, she is very apologetic at wasting their time � because her delivery has arrived! By way of apology, she teaches the farmer how to make the mystical bouquet and gives them one, suggesting that they gift it to their sweetheart.
* perhaps two events: one within 3 days of receiving the request, the other after that, when she berates them for being too long about it, but still thanks them profusely.

** Add a unique gift response for if you give her the bouquet.
 

Summer 6 hearts:
Aideen is upset - the night was too stuffy and she left the windows open, and Munchie must have got out! She cannot find him anywhere. Farmer offers to keep an eye out for him.
Farmer exits the house and finds Munchie, hidden beneath a bush. He's scared and a little scratched up. They take him back to Aideen. She smothers him with affection, thanks the farmer, and determines to take the cat to the vet.

Aideen comes running up to the farmer:
speak Aideen \"@! You have not, perchance, seen Baron Munchington, have you?\"/
emote farmer ?
speak Aideen \"It was most frightfully stuffy last night, so I left the window open. He must've escaped in the night!#$b#But he did not return home for his breakfast. And the Baron never misses breakfast. Never!#$b#
Oh no! What if those dreadful crabs got him!#$b#\"
question fork0 \"Please, will you help me look for him?#Of course!#No, find your own cat.

Afterwards she praises Jacob for his attentivess and desire to listen and not treat her like a crazy cat lady.

8 hearts (must have seen 6 heart event)

Farmer walks in just as Aideen gets off the phone. Aideen is noticeably upset. When probed, she confesses that her ex-boyfriend has got in contact with her, and he is now afianced and wishes for her to provide flowers for their wedding.

Farmer can try and console her, but she brushes it away:
"It is of little consequence, I was young, more in love with the thought of being in love, than I was actually fond of him. No, he has found a much better match now, and I shall be delighted to decorate his wedding. 
It is only... well...
*turns away, melanchololic music begins to play*
"It is silly... but I had thought, by now, that I would have found my One True Love."
*turns back* 
"I do not ask for much, do I just? I just wish for someone sophisticated with a sense of refinement. Someone who is kind, and can engage in lively dialogue." 
$q
#1. Perhaps your True Love is living right next door?
#2. Have you considered letting a humble farmer sweep you off your feet?
#3. Who needs love when you have cats?
#4. Love? Love is a lie.


�Next door? Oh, surely not Tristan, for all that I have a certain affection for him; he is barely civilized.#$b#Or do you mean Dr Jacob? Hmm... well, he is certainly kind and we have, on occasion, engaged in a rousing discussions of literature and the arts.#$b#Also, Baron Munchington is certainly fond of him. But I fear he would regard me as a mere shadow of his wife.�
(When: {"HasSeenEvent":"5295001" , "spouse:MisterGinger":"false"}

�Next door? Oh, surely not Sterling, he may exude a certain boyish charm, but no, he is barely civilized!#$b#Or do you mean Dr Jacob? Hmm... well, he is certainly kind and we have, on occasion, engaged in a rousing discussions of literature and the arts.#$b#Also, Baron Munchington is certainly fond of him. But I fear he would regard me as a mere shadow of his wife.�

Aideen confides in the farmer that she is starting to feel rather disinheartened in romance novels. For if they are to be believed, than surely her True Love would have entered her life by now. All she asks for is someone sophisticated, but kind; someone who can engage her in lively dialogue; and someone whom meets Munchie�s approval. 
Farmer can make some suggestions:
- Perhaps your True Love is living right next door?
	�Next door? Oh, surely not Tristan, for all that I have a certain affection for him; he is barely civilized.#$b#Or do you mean Dr Jacob? Hmm... well, he is certainly kind and we have, on occasion, engaged in a rousing discussions of literature and teh arts.#$b#Also, Baron Munchington is certainly fond of him. But I fear he would regard me as a mere shadow of his wife.�
- Have you considered letting a humble farmer sweep you off your feet?
	�Why, Mr @!^Why Ms @!#$b#Are you wishing to court me?#$b#You do exude a quaint rural charm.^I have never been courted by a lady before! This is most illuminating.#$b#And I have certainly grown fond of you. But love? Well, perhaps my tale is a slow burn, rather than a quick spark, yes?
- Pah, who needs love when you have cats?
	�Baron Munchington is certainly fine company, although he is not noted for his conversation.#$b#And I guess that I hoped I one day might have both.
- Romance novels are a lie - and so is love.
	�Such a nihilistic perspective, @. I am not sure I appreciate your cynicism. Please, take it elsewhere.


The plot can fork two ways here: farmer can give Aideen a bouquet and start dating her.

After X amount of days, if she is not dating the farmer, we will find someway to possibly spark the rival hearts event. This could go in two ways: Jacob could make a suggestion to farmer that he finds her quite delightful, and farmer could imply that Aideen is romantically attracted to him.

Alternately, Aideen herself could ask what farmer thinks of the situation.

***********************

Lexi
------
***********************

Vincent talks about seeing the monster on the beach. But no one believes him!

Another event for if Jessie and Vincent are friends: Farmer comes upon them talking to one another about Lexi, or rather, Vincent is talking and Jessie is listening.

introductory event:
farmer enters into cave. Lexi sees them, and looks about herself, wondering where to run to.
Farmer has an option:
"I'm not going to hurt you".
"Who are you?" 
	"You not afraid of me? My name, Lexi. This, my home. Welcome."
"What are you?"
	"Not monster! I is person of deep. Merperson, yesno? Not know. Do know, my name. It is Lexi."
"What be your name, person of earth?" 

(much like the dwarf intro)
2 hearts: 
Lexi is staring at a pot plant. It is wilted. Lexi is sad that her friend plant is dying. She has given it good care, watered it every day, sung to it.
Farmer can advise:
- plants need sunlight.
- plants don't drink seawater.
- perhaps it doesn't like your singing?

8 hearts:
Lexi talks about the time when they lived with Mother, in a big rambling house with many rooms. Lexi would sometimes sneak out early in the morning for a swim. One day, they followed the river and found themselves at the beach.
It was quiet, and felt safe, until they got to the edge of the ocean, and the waves crashed against the shore. They were scared.
But there was a girl. Well a woman. She came to the beach and stripped off her outside skin, then plunged into the waves, not even slightly scared!
Lexi was awed. But they remembered how the last time one of the people from the village had seen them, and screamed.
So they stayed hidden.
After that, always when Lexi came to the beach, they would look for the young woman. 
Then one day, the woman got pulled out to sea in a riptide, and Lexi realised that she was in trouble.
They dove into the sea without a thought, and rescued her, bringing her back to shore.
The woman was started to see Lexi, but she did not seem scared. More intrigued.
Her name was Mona, a name Lexi liked because it was close to Moana, which they knew meant the sea.
They became friends.

Starts with Lexi standing on the beach, maybe the headland, staring out to sea. Rainy day, so no one around.
"Oh, sorry friend @! Is lost in thoughts. Remembering an old friend."
emote farmer ?
speak Leximonster \"Would you like to hear tale?\"/
emote farmer :)
faceDirection Leximonster 2/
speak Leximonster \"It is an old tale. Happen many, many years ago. When I was child.
Lived in big house with Mother. Had many rooms and books and other things. I love Mother very much, but not love be indoors. Love outside; rain on face and wind on whisker-gill.
But not save to go out when sun high in sky. Sun too hot, make skin feel bad. And too many eyes to see. Too many voices to scream 'Monster'!
In dawn, when sky painted in orange-pink, I would swim. In river, swim to beach, collect shells for Mother.
	(switch to location: beach, Lexi's head appear in river to sea, then Lexi climb out, walk to rock pools.
	Use a temp beach map with Elliott's cabin removed, maybe a few other changes?
	Use autumn one for morning hues, maybe try changing light levels?
	Set to "indoor" so no rain.)
But was very silly; for though I love water... am fraid of waves.
Then one day, came to swim, and found no longer had place alone.
        (show a little play where Mona wanders onto the beach, looks around. Lexi ducks into the bushes. Mona then walks into the water.
	Swims back and forth.)
Fade to black
She come every day. Would watch her. Want to talk to her, be friends. But scared.
Not good memory of people friends.
One day come to swim... and everything change.
	(Mona swimming back and forth then suddenly she disappears. Lexi jumps with a ! and runs to the shore. They hesitate for a moment, shaking. Mona's head appears, with a 'help' emote above it. Then she disappears again.

Two hearts:
Oliver is sitting in front of his computer, farmer walks in. Oliver doesn't notice.
Mutters to himself. Groans.
Farmer walks up to him. He jumps. 
Composes himself.

speak Oliver \"Nothing... it's dumb. Just a video game.\"/
question fork0:
	Hey, nothing dumb about that. Video games are great!
	Shouldn't you be studying or something?

Four hearts Oliver, four hearts Lexi:
(two parts)
conditional on seeing Lexi's 2 heart event.

Part one:
Oliver finds Friend Gull on the beach. Friend Gull is clearly injured. 
He picks up the little bird and carries him up to see the vet.
Lexi surfaces at the edge of the screen, sees what is happening and emotes (!,?, or cloud?)
Farmer meets him along the way and joins him.
Cut to Jacob tending to Friend Gull.
Something has damaged the little bird's wing, he's going to need to be splinted and nursed back to health. 
Oliver asks if he can stay and help. 
Jacob replies yes, and Oliver comments that he needs to contact his mother to tell her where he is. Realizes he has lost his phone.
Farmer offers to get in touch with Josephine.

Part two:
Phone is not on beach. But if farmer enters Lexi's cave, finds Lexi playing with phone.
"He took Friend Gull away... The human youngling. Why he take him?"
question:
- Friend Gull was injured, he took him to someone who can help. 
	> "Poor Friend Gull. I want help, but not fast enough. Not know how. Hope Friend Gull be okay.
- Your friend was hurt. But he'll be okay. // friendship +50
	> "Poor Friend Gull. 
- What does it matter? It's only a bird. //friendship -50
	> "Is not just bird. Is not 'it'. He is friend! That mean thing to say. You care about your friends, yes? Not want see them hurt."
Lexi holds up the phone. 
"This beeping metal box, is his, yes? You think if I give back, he let me see Friend Gull? Friend Gull be frightened. Need friend. Not like be alone."

Part three:
Oliver visits the beach (as he often does), Lexi pops out of the water. He just about jumps out of his skin at the sight of her.


Six hearts Oliver:
"If you don't want to do it, Mom, just tell them 'no!'. Don't use me as your 'Get Out of Life' card.$a",
"But Oliver..."
move OliverK 0 3 2/playSound doorOpen/doAction X Y/move OliverK 0 3 1/jump OliverK

emote farmer ?
speak OliverK \"Hah. Mom's being totally unreasonable. So, you know I was sick as a kid, right? It was pretty bad. We were in and out of hospital for years. I almost died, I guess, several times.$2#$b#
But I'm fine now! I've been in remission for seven years, which is basically cured. But Mom still treats me like I'm that sickly kid.#$b#And now she's turning down an awesome opportunity and blaming it on me.$a\"/ 
Farmer replies ?.
"Oh, Mom used to be this big name opera singer. The Zuzu Nightingale. You might've heard of her? She gave it all up when I got sick, but she still sings and stuff. Practises every morning!
Now her old producer, he's pushing her for a reunion concert. And she's saying 'no'. Which is cool, whatever, it's her life. Except that she's telling him it's because of me.
If she really wants to do it, then she should do it!
And if she doesn't, then just tell them already! I'm sick of being her excuse. 
emote farmer 40
quickQuestion:
- Does she know you feel this way?
	> Yes! I've told her enough times. She just doesn't listen...
- She's your mother... she loves you! Show her some respect.
	> Don't you think I know that? And I'm not sure you quite get my point.
- Sounds manipulative. Don't let her use you like that.
	> Hey, that's a bit harsh! I love my mom.

post event with Josephine
Oliver came and talked to me... Goodness, I hadn't realized how much of a young man he's become. I guess it's hard to see past the child he was.\"/she sighs and turns away.
I suppose I have been a little unreasonable, @, that I had become too much of the mother of a sick child to fail to see how he's grown up - and lost a part of myself in the process.
I do want to take up the offer you know! To perform in front of an audience... to become someone else for a while. To become her again, the Zuzu Nightingale...
What do you think, @?
> Sounds great, you should definitely do it!
> It's your decision, the choice must be your own.
> As long as your voice is up for it! 
> What does your husband think?

After she leaves, farmer will receive letters in the mail from her, sending small items and expressing gratitude and delight at becoming the nightingale again.
She will then attend the Luau and probably Winter Star, and visit her son twice a month and on his birthday. (Spawn them both at the bus stop those days, and have them walk around town).

Have Josephine's other events be interactions with other NPCs... perhaps she could join the exercise class? Lewis trying to suck up to her about something?

Oliver sends a note to farmer, insisting he has something important to discuss.
Set a conversation topic so if you talk to him after seeing it he says "sssh, I don't want to talk about it here! Meet me in the inn" or something?
He confesses that Kennedy has shown the picture of Lexi to her aunt (who is a scientist studying cryptids, Kennedy is very sceptical about it all) and her aunt is coming out there with a photographer to see if she can capture an elusive snapshot!
Oliver is both embarrassed and concerned. He's worried Lexi will no longer trust him and he's scared he might somehow be hurting her.
He asks, "what can we do?"
Options:
- Belittle and embarrass him. "You've been a fool! If anything happens to Lexi, it's all your fault." * Don't you think I know this? I came to you cos I thought you'd help, not rub it in! Fine. I'm leaving. (turn, walk out, door close.)
- Suggest he lies to the researcher  "You're just going to have to tell her you made it all up." * Yeh... and make myself look like an attention-seeking liar. But... I guess you're right. It's the best way. And I'm sure they're used to hoaxs.*pause* I don't suppose you'd consider putting on a rubber suit, would you?
- Ask Lexi if they'd like to go public. "Maybe we should ask Lexi what they want us to do." * I'm worried they'll be mad at me. But you're right, they deserve to know. And, who knows? Maybe Lexi'll want to become a celebrity. 

Conversation Topic, Jasper: "Cryptozoology Today? Oh, they are not too well regarded within the scientific community, as they favor a... sensationalist form of journalism. Oh but no, nothing so crass as a tabloid! And they do pay well.(blushes)"

Number one and two: you walk in on Oliver and Lexi talking. 
"You're not mad at me?"
"Mad? No, not mad. You want your friends to know me, and that not be bad thing. Be sad if want me to hide, pretend not exist.
But also, not want to be in reports, not want strangers to come find me. Not like to be called 'weird' or 'freak'. Not like to be treated like thing, not person.

Oliver drops by to invite you over to the Mayor's house for dinner. His Dad's in town and Mayor Lewis wanted to invite you for some reason.
He says you're to bring wine and come after 6pm.

triggered by wine in the inventory

Lewis meets you at the door, he's visible flustered because he wants to impress the Governor. He's had Gus prepare a meal and he's relieevd to see you. You arrive first, but the Governor and his family arrive shortly afterwards altogether.
(should he put the wine on ice, do you fridge wine? Must research).
Set up dinner table elaborately. MAybe Gus could be leaving as you arrive. Lewis is flustering around like a boy trying to impress his first date.
"Hello ... Lewis, isn't it! Pleasure to see you again, old boy. How's everything going? Josie's given me the tour of the town. It's look very nice.
And you must be ... err, what was your name again? @? Excellent! Pleased to meet you. Josie has told me all about you. 
Meanwhile, Oliver is looking a bit sulky. His Dad's not paying much attention to him.
Dinner starts maybe have some conversation.

Possibly around the focus of Mayoral elections.
"Oh, it's been a while since there was a Mayoral election. Heh, maybe you'll have some competition next time. What do you think, err, @, isn't it?"
"I'd give Lewis a run for his money."
"I guess we'll just have to wait and see." 
"I can't imagine anyone but Lewis as Mayor."

End with:
Well, it's been delightful getting to know you a bit better. It's a shame Josie and Ollie will be leaving soon. But it's time the boy returned to school, and I do rather miss my wife! Speaking of, Lewis old chap, still enjoying the bachelor life?
I have to say, living alone may have its perks, but the older I get, the longer and lonelier the evenings become. There's no special someone in your life?
Lewis looks stressed. /emote Lewis 28/
well, anyway, Josie's got her big reunion concert soon, and I'm sure Oliver'll be delighted to see his old school friends again, won't you lad?  
Oliver looks uncomfortable. "Well Dad... there's something I've been wanting to talk a-"

**************
Eyvinder
**************
Eyvinder is older than he looks, as trolls are very long lived.
During the time of the Mine Boon he would trade with the miners, trading goat meat and fish for fresh produce and seeds, and also doing tasks like heavy lifting etc.
He had a brief but passionate affair with one of the young women working there.
He loved her, would do anything for her, and had even contemplated a future for them together... then she came to tell him she was leaving.
She ended up marrying someone else.
He fell into hermiting, hating not her nor women, but deciding that humans, with their short lives and fickle nature, were far more trouble than they were worth. 
There were other issues too: promises broken, young men trying to prove their dominance etc by challenging him to fights... Eyvinder was a peaceful man, and it was easier just to slip back into the mountains with his goats.
What he didn't know is that his young woman was actually pregnant, and frightened at the possibility of raising a child (that might not even be fully human) alone had grasped at a suitor who promised her more of a future than just a wildman
living in the mountains did. She was also being pressured by her father etc, and the mines were failing... so she chose a better future for herself and the child, over love.
(I don't have a name for her yet, but I will soon! This is just me spilling out ideas).
She moved to the city with her new husband, and even though he knew that the child wasn't his, he loved their son as his own.
[The child, it may be implied, is Tristan, who felt the call to Stardew Valley in his blood.]

INTRODUCTION: 
Eyvinder catches you looking at something of his... maybe he's moved the posts that block the path to his garden. Farmer goes up to look, sees this figure working over the plants. Figure turns, glares, you make a hasty retreat.
Early dialogue is gruff and unfriendly. He grudgingly accepts gifts and mutters about humans being more trouble than they're worth. Cautions you that he's fine with you wandering around, just don't touch his plants and states that the goats
can be a bit irritable so don't mess with them. Gives the feeling that he's tolerating your presence the same way a person may tolerate the presence of a mouse: that they're too much trouble to get rid of but you're not going to be
trying to make friends with them.

SIX HEARTS:
You see the door to the hut is open and find Eyvinder inside, sitting on the stone floor. He tells you, haltingly because he's not one to wax poetical, about a woman he once knew. When he is finished, he tells you he might as well 
leave the building unlocked, because you might find a use for it and he trusts you enough to consider you a neighbour.

Evidence that the dwarves are alien?

The theories that Peasbody belittled you for?
> The very same.
speak Jasper \"I was so young, eager - and naive - to believe that the scientific community would embrace my theries, for truly, they were a little, er ... unconventional.\"/

questionFork
"I'd love to hear more."

speak Jasper \"You must know, of course, that the term 'dwarf' was termed when the first diminutive skeletons were unearthed. The name they called themselves, I discovered, is Smoluanu. this translates, roughly as 'sky people'.
It seems odd, does it not, that they would choose to live underground?
I have performed extensive research of the rock strata, and determined that approximately one thousand ago, there occured a geological event of catastrophic proportion.
This coincides with the greatest quantity of the fossilized bones.
There are those that believe the smoluanu are extinct, or that they are, instead, related to the goblins.  

OR:

Are you familiar with my first publication, 'Famous Journeys'?
farmer ?
It was a memoir, of sorts. A travelogue, written during my undergraduate days at ZuCU, detailing an expedition Cameron and I took to study the geological history of the Cascadian Mountains.
We found signs of inhabitants: cat-like eyes that glowed in our torchlight before they darted away. Cameron thought they must be kin to the goblin-folk, and I believed him/her. 
It was only later, when I came upon a paper about diminutive humanoid skeletons unearthed in similar underground environments, that I read the term 'dwarf'.
I went back, of course, but at that point it was too late. An earthquake had collapsed the caverns, and if any of the people remained, they did not wish to be found. 
What we did find, were some scrolls. And with the assistance of a linguist, we pieced together a rudimentary understanding of the language and assembled a makeshift translation guide.

"Oh Jasper... have you been up all night researching, again?"
"I cannot help it, Gunther. Sleep is evasive when the truth is so close at hand."
"You've found it then, evidence to support your theories? Are dwarves really from another planet? Or merely the goblins subterranean cousins, as Peasbody believes?"
"Peasbody..." emote Jasper angry
"Not yet... but I am so close I can all but taste it. By all accounts - both scientific and anecdotal - the dwarves - smouluana - were technologically advanced, with ways of harnessing the earth's energy in manners we cannot begin to understand.
So where did they go? Could they truly have been defeated by a race as technologically primative as the shadowfolk? Or..."
"... perhaps they returned to their home planet?"
"You're not mocking me, are you Gunther?"
"Of course not, Professor Jasper. But you must realize..."
