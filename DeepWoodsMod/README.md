#### About the Mod

- **Unique and Immersive Experience**  
A vast and deep forest generated anew in every game and on every visit on-the-fly. You never know what the next corner, the next level, and the next path might bring.

- **Multiplayer Support**  
Explore, forage, and discover the forest with your friends! But make sure you don't lose each other.

- **Highly Configurable**  
The config file lets you change hundreds of settings and values, that control level generation, monster strengths, chances for loot, and more.

- **Danger with Great Rewards**  
The deeper you go, the more there is to discover. But the forest can be ruthless. Strong and fast monsters, unique infested levels, and more dangers are waiting for you.
